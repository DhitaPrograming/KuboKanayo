        <h3>Our Philosophy: Kubo & Kanayo</h3>
        <p><strong>Kubo</strong> is inspired by the warmth of a humble space, a place to think, dream, and build. In Indonesian and Filipino culture, kubo refers to a small hut or shelter, simple, grounded, yet full of life and stories.</p>
        <p><strong>Kanayo</strong> is a name we gave meaning to, a symbol of belief, ambition, and identity. It represents the dreamer who dares, the creator who disrupts, and the soul who leads with culture.</p>
        <p>Together, "KuboKanayo" is more than a name — it’s a mindset. A fusion of space and spirit, intention and impact. This is where stories start. Where culture speaks. Where attention becomes emotion.</p>
